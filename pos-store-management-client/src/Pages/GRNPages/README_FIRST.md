## 📦 Example: Receiving 100 Units in 2 Deliveries

### Day 1: First Truck Arrives (50 units)
```
1. Create GRN #1 with 50 units
   ↓
2. Inventory increases by 50 INSTANTLY ✅
   ↓
3. These 50 units are ON THE SHELF RIGHT NOW
   ↓
4. You CAN SELL them immediately!
   ↓
5. Status: "Partially Received" (Blue 🔵)
   ↓
6. No approve button yet (more coming)
```

### Day 5: Second Truck Arrives (50 more units)
```
1. Create GRN #2 with 50 units
   ↓
2. Inventory increases by 50 more INSTANTLY ✅
   ↓
3. Total 100 units ON THE SHELF NOW
   ↓
4. All items available for sale!
   ↓
5. Status: "Fully Received" (Purple 🟣)
   ↓
6. Approve button APPEARS (ready for paperwork)
```

### Day 6: Manager Approves
```
1. Manager clicks "Approve"
   ↓
2. Inventory: NO CHANGE (already updated in Day 1 & 5!)
   ↓
3. What happens:
   - GRN locked (can't edit/delete)
   - Audit trail completed
   - Payment finalized
   ↓
4. Status: "Approved" (Green 🟢)
```

## 🎯 Quick Facts

### ✅ What Happens When You CREATE a GRN:
- Stock increases **immediately**
- Items go to shelf **right now**
- Available for sale **instantly**
- NO waiting for approval

### 📝 What Happens When You APPROVE a GRN:
- Stock: **No change** (already updated!)
- Record: **Gets locked** (can't edit)
- Audit: **Completed**
- Payment: **Finalized**

## 🤔 Common Confusion (Now Cleared Up!)

### ❌ WRONG Thinking:
"I created GRN with 50 units but haven't approved yet, so those 50 units are NOT in stock"

### ✅ CORRECT Reality:
"I created GRN with 50 units → Those 50 units ARE in stock RIGHT NOW and I can use them immediately!"

## 🎨 Status Colors Meaning

### 🔵 Blue - "Partially Received"
- Some items received and **ALREADY IN STOCK** ✅
- Can use these items **RIGHT NOW**
- No approve button (more items coming)

### 🟣 Purple - "Fully Received"
- ALL items received and **ALREADY IN STOCK** ✅
- **APPROVE BUTTON APPEARS** here
- Approval is for paperwork only

### 🟢 Green - "Approved"
- Paperwork complete
- Record locked
- Inventory **unchanged** (was updated when GRN created)

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy

Think of receiving goods like a grocery store:

```
🚚 Delivery truck arrives
  ↓
📦 Workers unload boxes
  ↓
🏪 PUT ITEMS ON SHELF IMMEDIATELY ← (Inventory updates!)
  ↓
💰 Customers can buy them RIGHT NOW
  ↓
📋 Manager signs delivery paperwork later ← (Approval!)
  ↓
🔒 File paperwork in office
```

You DON'T leave milk in the receiving area waiting for the manager to sign paperwork before putting it on the shelf!
