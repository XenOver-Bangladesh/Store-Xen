2. ✅ Revert inventory quantities
3. ✅ Revert PO status to "Sent"
4. ✅ Delete payment record
5. ✅ Delete GRN record

### On GRN Approve:
1. ✅ Mark as "Approved"
2. ✅ Add approval timestamp
3. ✅ Prevent further edits/deletes

## 🎯 Status Flow

```
Purchase Order (Sent)
        ↓
    Create GRN
        ↓
   [Pending] ──→ [Partially Received] ──→ [Received] ──→ [Approved]
       ↓                ↓                      ↓
   (No items      (Some items           (All items
    received)      received)             received)
```
